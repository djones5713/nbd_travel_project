    "description": " Beyond Honolulu, Oahu’s landscape includes rainforests,steep ridges, waterfalls and pineapple and sugarcane fields. Ringing the island are scenic villages and beaches such as Hanauma Bay, Kailua Beach, Makaha Beach and Waimea Bay. The North Shore is a quiet, laid-back area where visitors can sample a Hawaiian plate lunch and some shave ice before hitting one of its prime surfing and snorkeling spots. Other popular pastimes are golf, boating and hiking, with scenic trails at Diamond Head crater, Manoa Falls and Kaena Point, Oahu’s westernmost tip."

    "description": " Highlights of northern Italy include exploring the lakeside towns of Lombardy, hiking the hillside-hugging villages of Cinque Terre and downhill skiing in the Italian Alps. Central Italy is known for the rolling vineyards of Tuscany and Umbria, as well as Pisa’s iconic leaning tower. Travel farther south to find Naples, known for its pizza; the rugged Amalfi Coast, where picturesque towns hang precariously over cliffs; and Pompeii's 2,000-year-old remains. Off the southern tip of the peninsula, Sicily offers ancient ruins, beaches and an active volcano."
